# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AL-ATP-001.

---

## Contribution Categories

### ✅ Accepted

- **Protocol refinements** based on synthesis trial results
- **Operator feedback** on clarity, timing, or measurements
- **Troubleshooting additions** from real cooking attempts
- **Substrate alternatives** with PLU documentation
- **Regional procurement variations** (different cities/stores)
- **Error corrections** in measurements or procedures
- **New protocols** within scope (Korean nutritional synthesis)

### 🔄 Under Review

- **Fusion protocols** (requires justification for cuisine blending)
- **Non-standard equipment** requirements
- **Protocols requiring specialized training**
- **Significant departures from OSINT-verified sources**

### ❌ Rejected

- **Non-metric units** — This is a metric-only system
- **Unquantified instructions** — "Season to taste" is not valid
- **Protocols outside scope** — AL-ATP-001 focuses on Korean synthesis
- **Removal of safety/QC checkpoints** — These are non-negotiable

---

## Submission Requirements

All protocol contributions must include:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Reagent List** | Complete, with designations (D, G, K, etc.) |
| **Substrate List** | With PLU codes where applicable |
| **Equipment List** | Referenced to [[Equipment & Materials]] |
| **Step-by-Step Procedure** | Numbered, quantified, no ambiguity |
| **QC Checkpoints** | Visual or tactile verification points |
| **Troubleshooting Matrix** | Common failures and corrective actions |
| **OSINT Verification** | Cross-reference to established sources |

> [!tip] The Core Principle
> If an operator who has never made this dish before follows your protocol, will they succeed?
> 
> If you can't answer "yes" confidently, the protocol needs more detail.

## Human Trial Feedback

The most valuable contributions come from actual synthesis attempts.

### What to Report

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Protocol** | ATP-A |
| **Date** | 2024-12-15 |
| **Outcome** | Success / Partial Success / Failure |
| **Deviations** | "Substituted zucchini for yellow squash" |
| **Observations** | "Needed 5 extra minutes for potatoes" |
| **Flavor Notes** | "Slightly too salty, will reduce doenjang next time" |
| **Photos** | Optional but helpful |

### Where to Submit

For now, direct feedback to the Principal Investigator. A formal logging system is under development.

---

## Review Process

1. **Initial Review** — Does the submission include all requirements?
2. **OSINT Verification** — Cross-reference against Korean culinary authorities
3. **Format Alignment** — Match existing documentation style
4. **Integration** — Add to protocol suite
5. **Human Trial** — Test when possible
6. **Publication** — Release to vault

---

## Documentation Standards

### Voice & Tone

- Clear and direct
- Encouraging, not intimidating
- Lab terminology where it adds clarity
- No assumptions about prior cooking knowledge
- Explain *why* when it helps understanding

### Formatting

- Proper markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Consistent callout usage (tip, warning, note, etc.)
- Tables for specifications and matrices
- Mermaid diagrams for complex flows
- Footer with Aeryeok Labs branding

### Measurements

- **Always metric** (mL, g, cm)
- Tablespoon/teaspoon equivalents acceptable as secondary
- Specific times (not "until done")
- Temperature references where applicable

## Code of Conduct

This is a nutritional synthesis repository designed to help someone learn to cook.

- **Be respectful** — The Operator is trying their best
- **Document failures honestly** — They help everyone learn
- **Prioritize safety** — Include relevant warnings
- **No gatekeeping** — "Real cooks" don't use recipes? This isn't for them.
- **Assume good faith** — Everyone's learning
