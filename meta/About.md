# About AL-ATP-001

---

## Project Origin

This protocol suite was developed under... unusual conditions.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Principal Investigator** | Has zero prior exposure to target compounds (has never tasted Korean food) |
| **Target Operator** | Has laboratory background, zero culinary synthesis experience |
| **Research Methodology** | OSINT verification only (recipes from the internet) |
| **Facility** | Operator's apartment, Vancouver, BC |

Rather than acquiring prepared compounds from commercial sources (i.e., restaurants), this project documents synthesis procedures for operator self-sufficiency.

---

## Why This Format?

The target operator's professional background is in medical laboratory sciences. Standard recipe formats cause decision paralysis. This format:

- **Leverages existing cognitive frameworks** — She already follows SOPs at work
- **Eliminates ambiguous terminology** — No "season to taste" or "cook until done"
- **Provides quantified measurements** — Specific volumes and times
- **Includes QC checkpoints** — Visual/tactile verification at critical stages
- **Reduces paralysis in fatigued states** — Just follow the steps

> [!note] The Core Insight
> Cooking is just a laboratory protocol with edible outputs. If you can run a cell count, you can run a stove.
> 
> The terminology is different, but the logic is identical:
> - Follow the procedure
> - Monitor the reaction
> - Hit your checkpoints
> - Log anomalies

## OSINT Verification

All protocols have been verified against established open-source intelligence from Korean culinary authorities:

| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Maangchi | ✅ Cross-referenced |
| Korean Bapsang | ✅ Cross-referenced |
| Beyond Kimchee | ✅ Cross-referenced |

Ingredient proportions and techniques have been validated against multiple sources to ensure protocol accuracy.

## Experimental Status

> [!warning] Classification: EXPERIMENTAL
> These protocols have not undergone human trials by the Principal Investigator.
> 
> **PI Disclosure:** I have never tasted any of the target compounds. I don't know what doenjang-jjigae is supposed to taste like. I researched it, cross-referenced recipes, and wrote this up—but my gustatory verification is zero.
> 
> The Operator's palate has final authority.

## Liability Assignment

> [!info] Who's Responsible If It Goes Wrong
> 
> **If the output tastes bad:** That's a protocol design error. Blame the PI.
> 
> **If the Operator followed the protocol correctly:** The Operator is not at fault.
> 
> **If the output tastes good:** Log it. Notify PI. Protocol validated.
> 
> The entire point is that the Operator is following instructions in good faith. Any failure is attributable to the instructions themselves.
