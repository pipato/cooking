## §4.1 Chemical Reagents

*These are the sauces and pastes. They last forever in the fridge.*

| Designation | Common Name | What It Is | Stability |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Reagent D** | [[Doenjang]] | Fermented soybean paste (savory, earthy, pungent) | 12+ months @ 4°C |
| **Reagent G** | [[Gochujang]] | Fermented chili paste (sweet, spicy, umami) | 12+ months @ 4°C |
| **Reagent K** | [[Gochugaru]] | Korean chili flakes (fruity heat, bright red) | 12+ months @ 4°C (freezer is better) |
| **Solvent L** | Sesame Oil | Nutty, aromatic finishing oil | Stable |
| **Catalyst S** | Soy Sauce | Salty, umami, you know this one | Stable |
| **Aqueous Base** | Rice Rinse Water | The starchy water from washing rice | Use immediately |
| **Textural Agent** | Sesame Seeds | Crunchy, nutty garnish | Stable |

> [!tip] Rice Rinse Water
> When you wash uncooked rice before cooking it, save the cloudy water from the 2nd or 3rd rinse.
> 
> That starch-enriched water makes doenjang-jjigae better—thicker body, better binding.
> 
> If you don't have rice rinse water, regular water is fine. It'll just be slightly thinner.

> [!note] One-Time Purchases
> Reagents D, G, and K are **buy once, use for months** items.
> 
> A single container of each will last you through dozens of protocols. The initial H-Mart trip is an investment that pays off.

## §4.2 Protein Substrates

| Substrate | Application | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Beef Brisket (thinly sliced) | ATP-A, ATP-B | Ask the butcher or find pre-sliced at H-Mart |
| Pork Belly (thinly sliced) | ATP-A, ATP-B | **Primary protein for ATP-B**; pre-sliced at Korean grocers |
| Firm Tofu | ATP-A | Handle gently—it falls apart easily |

> [!tip] Pre-Sliced Proteins
> Asian grocery stores (H-Mart, T&T) sell proteins pre-sliced for hot pot and BBQ.
> 
> This saves you the trouble of slicing and ensures consistent thickness. Look in the meat section for packages labeled "bulgogi cut" or "hot pot sliced."

## §4.3 Vegetable Substrate Identification

Every piece of produce has a PLU (Price Look-Up) sticker. Here's how to read them:

| Code Format | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 4-digit (e.g., 4065) | Conventionally grown |
| 5-digit starting with **9** (e.g., 94065) | Organically grown |
| 5-digit starting with **8** (e.g., 84065) | Genetically modified (rarely used) |

> [!success] Procurement Rule
> **Organic (9xxxx) is nice to have, not required.**
> 
> If the organic version isn't available or costs significantly more, conventional (4-digit) is perfectly fine for all protocols.

See [[PLU Reference]] for a complete code matrix.

### Common Substrates by Protocol

| Substrate | Standard PLU | Organic PLU | Visual ID |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Potato (Russet) | 4072 | 94072 | Brown, oblong tuber |
| Onion (Yellow) | 4093 | 94093 | Golden papery skin |
| Zucchini | 4067 | 94067 | Green elongated gourd |
| Cabbage (Green) | 4069 | 94069 | Dense leafy sphere |
| Carrot | 4562 | 94562 | Orange tapered root |
| Swiss Chard | 4586 | 94586 | Large leaves, colorful stems |
| Kale | 4627 | 94627 | Dark, ruffled leaves |
| Garlic | 4608 | 94608 | Papery white bulb |
| Ginger | 4612 | 94612 | Tan knobby rhizome |
| Green Onion | 4068 | 94068 | Long green tubes |
| Korean Chili / Jalapeño | 4693 | 94693 | Green or red pepper |

| **T&T Supermarket** | Proteins, produce, backup reagents | Good for pre-sliced meats |
| **Whole Foods** | Organic produce | Premium pricing, skip unless convenient |
| **Save-On-Foods** | General produce, backup | Check the "international" aisle for soy sauce, sesame oil |
| **Your local grocery** | Basics | Onions, potatoes, carrots—you don't need H-Mart for these |

> [!tip] The H-Mart Trip
> Your first H-Mart run will get you:
> - Doenjang (ATP-A)
> - Gochujang (ATP-B)
> - Gochugaru (ATP-B)
> - Sesame oil (all protocols)
> - Sesame seeds (ATP-B, ATP-C)
> - Pre-sliced meats (optional)
> 
> This covers multiple protocols. After the initial investment, you're just buying fresh produce.
