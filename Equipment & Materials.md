# 🔧 Equipment & Materials

> [!info] Pre-Protocol Requirement
> All hardware must be clean and dry prior to synthesis initiation.
> 
> *Translation: Make sure your pots are washed and not wet. Wet pots + hot oil = bad time.*

## §3.1 Thermal Processing Units

*In normal terms: pots, pans, and your stove.*

| Hardware | Lab Designation | Specification | Protocol Assignment |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Large Pot | Primary Reactor | 3–4 L capacity, any material | [[Protocol A - Aqueous Phase Extraction\|ATP-A]] |
| Pan or Wok | Conductive Surface | ~30 cm diameter, high-sided preferred | [[Protocol B - Exothermic Surface Reaction\|ATP-B]] |
| Medium Pot | Secondary Reactor | 2–3 L capacity | [[Protocol C - Stovetop-Assisted Wilting\|ATP-C]] |
| Stovetop | Thermal Source | Gas or electric | All Protocols |

> [!tip] Equipment Notes
> - **Stainless steel or ceramic** is ideal for the Primary Reactor (large pot) because doenjang doesn't react with it
> - **High-sided pan** for ATP-B prevents splatter from escaping
> - You probably already own all of this

---

## §3.2 Specimen Handling Tools

*In normal terms: knives, cutting boards, spoons, and bowls.*

| Hardware | Lab Designation | Specification | Protocol Assignment |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Chef's Knife | Substrate Reduction Blade | 15–20 cm, whatever you have | All Protocols |
| Cutting Board | Cutting Platform | Non-porous surface (plastic or wood) | All Protocols |
| Spatula/Wooden Spoon | Agitation Device | Heat-resistant | ATP-A, ATP-B |
| Colander | Drainage Apparatus | Fine mesh preferred | ATP-C |
| Tongs | Extraction Tool | Any kind | ATP-A, ATP-C |
| Clean Kitchen Towel | Compression Textile | Lint-free, for squeezing greens | ATP-C |
| Medium Bowl | Mixing Vessel | Non-reactive (glass, ceramic, steel) | ATP-B, ATP-C |
| Small Bowl | Beaker | For mixing the sauce/slurry | ATP-B |

## §3.3 Measurement & QC Instruments

| Instrument | Lab Designation | Specification | Function |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Measuring Spoons | Volumetric Dispenser | 15mL / 5mL / 2.5mL set | Reagent dosing |
| Measuring Cup | Liquid Measurement Device | mL markings required | Solvent measurement |
| Timer | Chronometer | Phone timer works fine | **CRITICAL** for ATP-C |
| Fork or Chopstick | Stainless Steel Probe | — | Poking things to check if done |

> [!danger] Critical Instrument: Chronometer (Timer)
> The **timer is mission-critical** for [[Protocol C - Stovetop-Assisted Wilting|ATP-C]].
> 
> You have exactly 60 seconds of blanching time. Exceeding this results in:
> - Chlorophyll degradation (greens turn olive/brown)
> - Textural failure (mushy instead of tender-crisp)
> 
> **Set a timer. Don't eyeball it.**
> 
> Your phone's timer is perfectly adequate for this purpose.

## §3.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

| Equipment | Lab Designation | Hazard Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Oven Mitts | Thermal Protection | Contact burns from handling hot reactors |
| Apron | Splash Guard | Lipid splatter during [[Protocol B - Exothermic Surface Reaction\|ATP-B]] |
| Glasses | Optical Protection | Onion-induced lacrimation (optional) |

> [!tip] Optical Protection Advisory
> When you cut onions, they release syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which is why your eyes water.
> 
> **Mitigation options:**
> - Wear glasses or safety glasses (creates a barrier)
> - Wear contact lenses (also creates a barrier—seriously, this works)
> - Refrigerate onions before cutting (cold reduces volatility)
> - Cut near a vent or open window
> - Accept the tears as part of the process
> 
> You'll figure out what works for you.

## Pre-Protocol Checklists

### ATP-A: Aqueous Phase Extraction (Doenjang-jjigae)

Before you start, confirm you have:

- [ ] Large pot (3–4 L)
- [ ] Stovetop access
- [ ] Knife + cutting board
- [ ] Wooden spoon or spatula
- [ ] Fork or chopstick (for poking potatoes)
- [ ] Oven mitts

### ATP-B: Exothermic Surface Reaction (Jeyuk-bokkeum)

Before you start, confirm you have:

- [ ] Large pan or wok (~30 cm)
- [ ] Stovetop access
- [ ] Knife + cutting board
- [ ] Small bowl (for making the sauce)
- [ ] Spatula or wooden spoon
- [ ] Oven mitts
- [ ] Apron (oil will splatter)

### ATP-C: Stovetop-Assisted Wilting (Namul)

Before you start, confirm you have:

- [ ] Medium pot (2–3 L)
- [ ] Stovetop access
- [ ] Colander
- [ ] Clean kitchen towel
- [ ] Medium bowl
- [ ] **TIMER** ⚠️ (this is critical)
- [ ] Oven mitts

## Equipment You Probably Already Have

> [!success] Good News
> Looking at this list, you almost certainly own everything required for AL-ATP-001 protocols.
> 
> Standard kitchen equipment is sufficient. No specialized hardware required.
> 
> | Item | Probability You Own It |
> |------|------------------------|
> | Pot | 100% |
> | Pan | 100% |
> | Knife | 100% |
> | Cutting board | 100% |
> | Wooden spoon | 95% |
> | Measuring spoons | 90% |
> | Timer (phone) | 100% |
> | Colander | 85% |
> 
> If you're missing a colander, a mesh strainer works. If you're missing measuring spoons, we can work around it with tablespoon/teaspoon estimates.
