# AL-ATP-001: Nutritional Synthesis Protocols

> [!abstract] Mission Statement
> Cellular respiration through thermal synthesis.
> 
> *Translation: Making sure you eat actual food.*

---

## Project Overview

**AL-ATP-001** is an experimental nutritional synthesis protocol suite developed by Aeryeok Labs for deployment in high-fatigue academic environments.

The system converts agricultural substrates into bioavailable energy compounds through standardized thermal processing procedures designed for operators with laboratory backgrounds but no prior culinary synthesis experience.

> [!note] Operator Assurance
> **You already know how to do this.**
> 
> If you can run a cell count, you can run a stove. Same logic:
> - Follow the protocol
> - Monitor the reaction
> - Hit your checkpoints
> 
> The only difference is you get to eat the results.

## Project Disclaimers

> [!warning] Principal Investigator Disclosure
> These protocols were developed by a Principal Investigator with:
> - Zero prior exposure to target compounds
> - Zero gustatory reference data for Korean cuisine
> - Extensive OSINT research as sole verification method
> 
> **Translation:** I have literally never tasted any of this food.
> 
> All protocols have been verified against established OSINT sources (Maangchi, Korean Bapsang, Beyond Kimchee) but remain experimentally unconfirmed by PI.

> [!info] Liability Assignment
> In the event of synthesis failure, suboptimal organoleptic outcomes, or any result classified as "weird":
> 
> **All liability reverts to Principal Investigator.**
> 
> The Operator is following documented protocols in good faith. Any deviation from expected outcomes is attributable to:
> 1. Protocol design error (PI responsibility)
> 2. OSINT verification failure (PI responsibility)  
> 3. Fundamental misunderstanding of target cuisine (PI responsibility)
> 
> *You're just following the SOP. If it's bad, that's on me.*

> [!tip] Operator Palate Authority
> Your gustatory sensors supersede all protocol specifications.
> 
> If it tastes wrong to you, it's wrong. Adjust accordingly. You have override authority on all seasoning parameters.

## Emergency Protocols

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Smoke alarm activation | Ventilate facility; continue protocol if substrate salvageable |
| Excessive carbonization | Protocol failure; notify PI for debrief |
| Unexpected flavor profile | Document and proceed; may be feature not bug |
| Actually tastes good | Log results; notify PI immediately |
