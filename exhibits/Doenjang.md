## Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Korean Name** | 된장 (doenjang) |
| **Pronunciation** | "DWEN-jang" |
| **Base Composition** | Fermented soybeans + salt |

## Function in AL-ATP-001

| Protocol | Role |
|----------|------|
| [[Protocol A - Aqueous Phase Extraction\|ATP-A]] | Primary flavor base; dissolved in water to create broth |

You dissolve this in water/rice water and boil vegetables in it. That's the stew.

---

## On the Smell

> [!note] It Smells Funky (This Is Normal)
> When you open the container, it will smell... fermented. Earthy. Kind of intense.
> 
> This is correct. It's supposed to smell like that.
> 
> Once it's diluted in water and simmered with vegetables, it becomes rich and savory, not funky. Trust the process.

---

## Storage

| Condition | Duration |
|-----------|----------|
| Refrigerated (after opening) | 12+ months |
| Freezer | Essentially indefinite |
| Room temperature | Not recommended after opening |

One container will last you a long time. It doesn't go bad quickly.

## Substitution Warning

> [!danger] Do NOT Use Japanese Miso Instead
> They look similar but are not the same.
> 
> | Attribute | Doenjang | Miso |
> |-----------|----------|------|
> | Made From | Soybeans only | Soybeans + grain (rice/barley) |
> | Texture | Coarse, chunky | Smooth |
> | Flavor | Stronger, earthier | Milder, sweeter |
> | Used In | Korean stews | Japanese soups |
> 
> Miso will not give you the correct flavor for doenjang-jjigae. It's a completely different dish.
